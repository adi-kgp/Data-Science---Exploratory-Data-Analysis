Increased efforts to fight climate change and soaring power costs in parts of the world have renewed interest in nuclear power, raising the likelihood of an expansion of the industry after years of low investment because of safety concerns.

stocks plummeted Wednesday after three days of gains, as investors mulled over a mixed verdict from the midterm election results and highly anticipated inflation data looms on the docket. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) shed over 2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell by nearly 650 points, or roughly 2%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dragged down by almost 2.5%, or 260 points. Investors’ optimism during stocks' three-day rally was built on expectations that Republicans would gain ground and create gridlock in Washington. But the Republican red wave failed to materialize in the U.S. midterms. Democrats managed to flip a crucial Senate seat, with John Fetterman beating Mehmet Oz in the Pennsylvania race. As of late Wednesday, both House and Senate control remains in the balance. Georgia's U.S. Senate race, meanwhile, is heading to a runoff, with neither major candidate on track to win a majority of votes. The year after midterm elections tends to see the highest equity returns, according to LPL Financial. “Going back to 1951, a Democratic president with a Republican or split congress, the two most likely cases this election, has seen an average S&P 500 Index return of over 17% versus an overall average of just over 12%,” Barry Gilbert, asset allocation strategist at LPL Financial, wrote in a note. The final outcome of the midterm results may not be known for days or weeks, but Wall Street pros aren’t expecting a big move in markets.  “We expect the impact of the election to tilt the market positive, partly because we’ll have it behind us,” Gilbert added. “As far as markets are concerned, the policy impact is likely to be small, and market participants will continue to be more focused on central bank policy and inflation.” To that point, investors will turn their attention to Thursday morning's inflation report, as the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for October. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect headline CPI at an annual rate of 7.9%, down from 8.2% the month before. Even if the report shows prices starting to moderate, core\",\n","  'With mortgage rates hovering around 7%, some would-be buyers may wonder if they should put a down payment on a property before rates skyrocket higher — or wait for the housing market to cool further. In continuation of our series \"What to do in a bear market,\" Yahoo Finance asked several housing experts if buyers should purchase now or hold off. “If you are still able to afford what you\\'re looking to buy, even after the soaring mortgage rates, you have a lot more bargaining power now than you did six months ago,” according to Greg McBride, CFA, chief financial analyst for Bankrate. The time to buy depends on people\\'s individual situations, said Marc Geredes, COO of Sundae, an online real estate marketplace. “People need a place to live and it is very competitive to rent right now, as rental prices have been going up. Over the long term, residential real estate has always been a good long term investment,” he added. Experts say even though interest rates are high, at some point they are expected to go lower and homeowners may be able to refinance if they have enough equity in their homes. “According to the experts we consult with, we think prices are going to go back to pre-pandemic 2020 levels on a national level. It will vary city to city, metro to metro,” said Geredes. Much will depend on supply though, especially in the single family home sector which has seen more of a shortage than multi-family. “Until we have a lot more supply hitting these markets, I don\\'t think we\\'re gonna see a drastic decline in home prices,” Michael Gifford, the CEO the Splitero, told Yahoo Finance. Many home owners are locked in to ultra low rates after refinancing or buying during the pandemic. “That\\'s what we are seeing with a lot of the homeowners that we help. They have a three or three and a half percent mortgage,” said Gifford. “Right now, if you\\'re going to sell, there\\'s few things to buy on the market. Rents are still very expensive. So sellers have little to',\n","  '(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. is the world’s first public company to lose a trillion dollars in market value as a combination of rising inflation, tightening monetary policies and disappointing earnings updates triggered a historic selloff in the stock this year.

Amazon and Microsoft Corp. were neck-and-neck in the race to breach the unwelcome milestone, with the Windows software maker close behind after having lost $889 billion from a November 2021 peak. While technology and growth stocks have been punished throughout the year, fears of a recession have further dampened sentiment in the sector. The top five US technology companies by revenue have seen nearly $4 trillion in market value evaporate this year. The world’s largest online retailer has spent this year adjusting to a sharp slowdown in e-commerce growth as shoppers resumed pre-pandemic habits. Its shares have fallen almost 50% amid slowing sales, soaring costs and a jump in interest rates. Since the start of the year, co-founder Jeff Bezos has seen his fortune dwindle by about $83 billion to $109 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Last month, Amazon projected the slowest revenue growth for a holiday quarter in the company’s history as shoppers reduce their spending in the face of economic uncertainty. That sent its market value below $1 trillion for the first time since the pandemic-fueled rally in tech stocks more than two years ago. --With assistance from Divya Balji, Tom Contiliano and Jack Witzig.

Read this and more market news on the go with Yahoo Finance App. What’s hot? Anything but stocks for much of 2022. Many online savings accounts are paying north of 2.50%. A 6-month Treasury bond is yielding 4.62% on Treasury Direct. I-Bonds, the viral bond whose rate is pegged to inflation, is currently paying 6.89%. All this might be making a difference as the market digests interest rate moves amid the Fed\\'s ongoing fight against inflation. In a note on Tuesday, Bank of America’s Equity and Quant Strategy team said that clients unloaded a net $6 billion in U.S. equities, selling for the second straight week in the biggest outflows since April ‘21 — and across 11 sectors no less, the first time in five years that’s happened. And with a lot in the air and midterm election results to remove uncertainty — which is bullish, as Sam Ro wrote yesterday — a lot of indicators are leaving tea leaves for analysts to examine. One stands out from our friends at DataTrek: The two-year U.S. treasury is yielding 0.33 percentage points more than the five-year, “an unusually large difference,” DataTrek’s Nicholas Colas wrote. This is rare and has happened only a few times in recent decades: 1989, 2000, and 2006. It’s happening now and Colas says that it means that the market is saying the “Fed is going to start reducing rates in the next 1-2 years” or that there are structural inflation problems. In any case, Colas’s takeaway is that \"this is the most bullish indicator we’ve come across in weeks, even if its history says it is not especially good at calling stock market bottoms.” This is why everyone is going to be glued to the screens as the CPI report crosses Thursday, giving us the latest look at whether the Fed',\n","  \"Stocks rallied Tuesday as investors awaited the outcome of the midterm elections in the U.S. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) inched higher by 0.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) ticked higher by 335 points, or roughly 1%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) edged higher by 0.5% after wavering during afternoon trading. It was the third-straight day of gains for the major indexes ahead of another week of potential market-moving events: corporate earnings, midterm elections, and inflation data. Investors are focused on Tuesday’s midterm elections that will determine control of the House and Senate for the remainder of President Joe Biden’s first term. Historically, Wall Street has preferred a split Congress or White House, with political gridlock that could impede major policy changes, an outcome that investors see as favorable for equities. According to JPMorgan’s latest client survey, 39% of respondents were split on whether the U.S. midterm elections will be a positive catalyst for risk markets or non-event, while 21% expected negative implications. Regardless of the winner, some strategists argue that midterm outcomes have a “modest” influence in financial markets. “The overall near-term implications of the 2022 U.S. Midterm Elections are quite modest for FX markets,” Meera Chandan, FX strategist at JPMorgan, wrote in a note to clients. “Markets should thus continue taking guidance more from the Fed’s monetary policy decisions than from any new large fiscal packages. One wildcard worth flagging is the risk of renewed uncertainty around the debt ceiling.” Another closely watched item this week will be the Thursday release of October inflation data. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect headline CPI at an annual rate of 7.9%, down from 8.2% the month before. Even if the report shows prices starting to moderate, core CPI is far above the Fed’s comfort zone. “The problem is going to be that in month over month terms, I think we're still going to see a fairly strong core CPI,” Franklin Templeton Fixed Income CIO Sonal Desai told Yahoo Finance Live on Monday. “And I don't think that a combination like that, together with the relatively strong jobs numbers we got\",\n","  'Bring on Nov. 9. With the midterm elections underway today, investors are eyeing if Republicans could win back control of government and more effectively stop any and all legislation that could rattle markets. \"Gridlock, you\\'ve seen, has been pretty good for the markets,\" Maslansky and Partners president Lee Carter on Yahoo Finance Live. \"I think people are predicting that at least that\\'s the direction we\\'re going to go. And when we\\'ve talked to Republicans who are running, ... what we\\'re going to do from between now and 2024 is just stop Biden\\'s agenda.\" Recently, stocks are trading as if the Republicans — usually seen as pro business and markets —will make substantial progress. The S&P 500 has climbed nearly 5% in the past month despite a flurry of downbeat earnings reports from the likes of Amazon, Meta and many others. Investors may be right to be on the bullish side of the ledger. The S&P 500 has historically outperformed the market in the 12-month period after a midterm election, with an average return of 16.3% per data from US Bank. This is especially the case for the one and three month periods following the midterm elections, as the below graphic shows. Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

Fourth quarter earnings estimates for the S&P 500 have tanked 4.9% since Sept. 30, according to new research from Credit Suisse strategist Jonathan Golub. The downward revisions have been most acute in the tech space as the sector deals with slowing growth, which has led to large layoff announcements recently from the likes of Meta and Salesforce. \"In our view the path of inflation, interest rates, monetary policy, the economy, and earnings will continue to exert the greatest influence on markets over the next year,\" Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner in a note to clients warned. That assessment echoes what Sofi\\'s Liz Young told Yahoo Finance Live this week: \"Until we see consecutive months of inflation coming down in a meaningful way, I expect them to continue hiking and continue tightening,\" Young said. \"I think that they are quite comfortable with tightening maybe a bit too far, and then trying to sort of ask for forgiveness from markets later with the tools that they have to stimulate.\" She later added: \"I think the piece of it that hasn’t quite been priced in entirely is that earnings contraction.\" The saving grace here for investors: Earnings are still expected to grow in the fourth quarter, with Golub\\'s research presenting a path for S&P 500 earnings to rise 2.3% overall from a year ago. However, the overall picture isn\\'t pretty — especially when energy is taken out of the equation. Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

Meta said Wednesday it will slash 13% of its workforce, more than 11,000 employees, as it looks to redirect resources to Mark Zuckerberg\\'s metaverse project and appease angry shareholders. \"I want to take accountability for these decisions and for how we got here,\" Zuckerberg said in a message to employees. \"I know this is tough for everyone, and I’m especially sorry to those impacted. I view layoffs as a last resort, so we decided to rein in other sources of cost before letting teammates go. Overall, this will add up to a meaningful cultural shift in how we operate.\" Meta stock popped on hopes of a profit reacceleration in 2023, paring back the year-to-date decline to 69%. The stock was the top trending ticker on the Yahoo Finance platform until the early afternoon on Wednesday. Jefferies\\' Thill thinks Meta\\'s new cost cuts will support a higher stock price. \"Given Meta\\'s typical pattern of growing expenses below the low-end of guidance, we would not be surprised to see additional EPS upside ahead,\" Thill said. \"We expect the expense rationalization should support Meta stock trading at just 13x FY23 EPS (vs. 11x trough). Our $155 PT implies 18x our raised \\'23 EPS.\" The analyst maintained a Buy rating on Meta stock with a $155 price target, which assumes a 52% upside from current levels.

Read this and more market news on the go with Yahoo Finance App. Weird times. So I\\'m sitting on Yahoo Finance Live on jobs report Friday, almost in a state of disbelief. Non-farm payrolls rose by an impressive 261,000. That didn’t strike me as a recessionary print. Then an economist sitting next to me says he sees a recession in 2023 and a 2% rise in the unemployment rate. \"We have a recession call for next year,\" Deutsche Bank Securities Chief US Economist Matthew Luzzetti said. \"For a while, we\\'ve had that call. We expect it to happen around the middle of next year. We have the unemployment rate rising to 5.5% by the end of next year.\" Conflicting economic signals, no doubt about it. But conflicting signals are being seen across the economy, notably as it pertains to U.S. consumers pre-holiday and consumer-centric stocks. Under Armour’s third quarter sucked last week, and so did the company’s forward guidance. And yet the stock was embraced by the market. Crocs had a solid quarter, but inventory ballooned. Red flag, says my former analyst self. The Street welcomed the quarter anyway. Etsy had a squishy quarter, and the market took it in stride. Same goes EBay. Then Starbucks reported an 11% same-store sales increase despite ever-inflating prices for its various coffees. Where is the recession there? \"What we focus on is really: How do we sustain that ticket?\" Starbucks CFO Rachel Ruggeri told me and Yahoo Finance\\'s Brooke DiPalma in an interview. \"Because it isn\\'t just pricing, it\\'s actually volume as well, we\\'ve seen our customers purchase more... so we\\'re seeing increased volume.\" And Mastercard’s CEO Michel Miebach tells me there is nothing in his business that suggests recession is imminent. \"Currently, based on the data that we have, there is',\n","  'Don\\'t expect a big move in the markets following the much-awaited conclusion of the midterm elections, Wall Street pros contend. \"We actually think politics is going to have a somewhat minimal impact on the markets,\" Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management, said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above). Wells Fargo strategist Chris Harvey echoed Roland\\'s sentiments in a recent note to clients: \"Post-election, we would expect a small lift in the equity market over the next month (+1%) – assuming the CPI print on Thursday is not \\'hot,\\'\" Harvey wrote. \"Defensive sector outperformance (i.e., Utilities, Staples, Health Care) is expected to last assuming we see an Election Day \\'red wave.\\'\" Overall, investors don\\'t appear to share Wall Street\\'s muted optimism — at least not yet. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rallied 1% on Tuesday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) jumped more than 400 points, or roughly 1.3%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained about 0.9% after the index posted its worst weekly decline since January. Some of the most active stocks on the Yahoo Finance platform included relatively riskier plays such as Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Snap (SNAP), and Nvidia (NVDA) as traders embraced the risk-on vibes. Historical data suggests a positive bias in the market in the month ahead of the midterms is warranted. The S&P 500 has historically outperformed the market in the 12-month period after a midterm election, with an average return of 16.3%, per data from US Bank. That outperformance is especially the case for the one- and three-month periods following midterm elections. But given that the economy is still dealing with high levels of inflation and an unfriendly Federal Reserve hiking interest rates, investing pros may be right to prepare for a post-election hangover in the stock market. \"You\\'ve got to think about some of these big challenges that we have,\" Roland explained. \"The economy is clearly decelerating right now. We\\'re contending with inflation. I think the inflation data that we get on Thursday is probably much more important than the political backdrop right now. So we want to be'],\n"," 'TSLA': [\"U.S. stocks plummeted Wednesday after three days of gains, as investors mulled over a mixed verdict from the midterm election results and highly anticipated inflation data looms on the docket. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) shed over 2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell by nearly 650 points, or roughly 2%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dragged down by almost 2.5%, or 260 points. Investors’ optimism during stocks' three-day rally was built on expectations that Republicans would gain ground and create gridlock in Washington. But the Republican red wave failed to materialize in the U.S. midterms. Democrats managed to flip a crucial Senate seat, with John Fetterman beating Mehmet Oz in the Pennsylvania race. As of late Wednesday, both House and Senate control remains in the balance. Georgia's U.S. Senate race, meanwhile, is heading to a runoff, with neither major candidate on track to win a majority of votes. The year after midterm elections tends to see the highest equity returns, according to LPL Financial. “Going back to 1951, a Democratic president with a Republican or split congress, the two most likely cases this election, has seen an average S&P 500 Index return of over 17% versus an overall average of just over 12%,” Barry Gilbert, asset allocation strategist at LPL Financial, wrote in a note. The final outcome of the midterm results may not be known for days or weeks, but Wall Street pros aren’t expecting a big move in markets.  “We expect the impact of the election to tilt the market positive, partly because we’ll have it behind us,” Gilbert added. “As far as markets are concerned, the policy impact is likely to be small, and market participants will continue to be more focused on central bank policy and inflation.” To that point, investors will turn their attention to Thursday morning's inflation report, as the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for October. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect headline CPI at an annual rate of 7.9%, down from 8.2% the month before. Even if the report shows prices starting to moderate, core\",\n","  'With mortgage rates hovering around 7%, some would-be buyers may wonder if they should put a down payment on a property before rates skyrocket higher — or wait for the housing market to cool further. In continuation of our series \"What to do in a bear market,\" Yahoo Finance asked several housing experts if buyers should purchase now or hold off. “If you are still able to afford what you\\'re looking to buy, even after the soaring mortgage rates, you have a lot more bargaining power now than you did six months ago,” according to Greg McBride, CFA, chief financial analyst for Bankrate. The time to buy depends on people\\'s individual situations, said Marc Geredes, COO of Sundae, an online real estate marketplace. “People need a place to live and it is very competitive to rent right now, as rental prices have been going up. Over the long term, residential real estate has always been a good long term investment,” he added. Experts say even though interest rates are high, at some point they are expected to go lower and homeowners may be able to refinance if they have enough equity in their homes. “According to the experts we consult with, we think prices are going to go back to pre-pandemic 2020 levels on a national level. It will vary city to city, metro to metro,” said Geredes. Much will depend on supply though, especially in the single family home sector which has seen more of a shortage than multi-family. “Until we have a lot more supply hitting these markets, I don\\'t think we\\'re gonna see a drastic decline in home prices,” Michael Gifford, the CEO the Splitero, told Yahoo Finance. Many home owners are locked in to ultra low rates after refinancing or buying during the pandemic. “That\\'s what we are seeing with a lot of the homeowners that we help. They have a three or three and a half percent mortgage,” said Gifford. “Right now, if you\\'re going to sell, there\\'s few things to buy on the market. Rents are still very expensive. So sellers have little to',\n","  '(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. is the world’s first public company to lose a trillion dollars in market value as a combination of rising inflation, tightening monetary policies and disappointing earnings updates triggered a historic selloff in the stock this year.

Amazon and Microsoft Corp. were neck-and-neck in the race to breach the unwelcome milestone, with the Windows software maker close behind after having lost $889 billion from a November 2021 peak. While technology and growth stocks have been punished throughout the year, fears of a recession have further dampened sentiment in the sector. The top five US technology companies by revenue have seen nearly $4 trillion in market value evaporate this year. The world’s largest online retailer has spent this year adjusting to a sharp slowdown in e-commerce growth as shoppers resumed pre-pandemic habits. Its shares have fallen almost 50% amid slowing sales, soaring costs and a jump in interest rates. Since the start of the year, co-founder Jeff Bezos has seen his fortune dwindle by about $83 billion to $109 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Last month, Amazon projected the slowest revenue growth for a holiday quarter in the company’s history as shoppers reduce their spending in the face of economic uncertainty. That sent its market value below $1 trillion for the first time since the pandemic-fueled rally in tech stocks more than two years ago. --With assistance from Divya Balji, Tom Contiliano and Jack Witzig.

Some of the most active stocks on the Yahoo Finance platform included relatively riskier plays such as Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Snap (SNAP), and Nvidia (NVDA) as traders embraced the risk-on vibes. Historical data suggests a positive bias in the market in the month ahead of the midterms is warranted. The S&P 500 has historically outperformed the market in the 12-month period after a midterm election, with an average return of 16.3%, per data from US Bank. That outperformance is especially the case for the one- and three-month periods following midterm elections. But given that the economy is still dealing with high levels of inflation and an unfriendly Federal Reserve hiking interest rates, investing pros may be right to prepare for a post-election hangover in the stock market. \"You\\'ve got to think about some of these big challenges that we have,\" Roland explained. \"The economy is clearly decelerating right now.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) shed over 2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell by nearly 650 points, or roughly 2%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dragged down by almost 2.5%, or 260 points. Investors’ optimism during stocks' three-day rally was built on expectations that Republicans would gain ground and create gridlock in Washington. But the Republican red wave failed to materialize in the U.S. midterms. Democrats managed to flip a crucial Senate seat, with John Fetterman beating Mehmet Oz in the Pennsylvania race. As of late Wednesday, both House and Senate control remains in the balance. Georgia's U.S. Senate race, meanwhile, is heading to a runoff, with neither major candidate on track to win a majority of votes. The year after midterm elections tends to see the highest equity returns, according to LPL Financial. “Going back to 1951, a Democratic president with a Republican or split congress, the two most likely cases this election, has seen an average S&P 500 Index return of over 17% versus an overall average of just over 12%,” Barry Gilbert, asset allocation strategist at LPL Financial, wrote in a note. The final outcome of the midterm results may not be known for days or weeks, but Wall Street pros aren’t expecting a big move in markets.  “We expect the impact of the election to tilt the market positive, partly because we’ll have it behind us,” Gilbert added. “As far as markets are concerned, the policy impact is likely to be small, and market participants will continue to be more focused on central bank policy and inflation.” To that point, investors will turn their attention to Thursday morning's inflation report, as the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for October.

In continuation of our series \"What to do in a bear market,\" Yahoo Finance asked several housing experts if buyers should purchase now or hold off. “If you are still able to afford what you\\'re looking to buy, even after the soaring mortgage rates, you have a lot more bargaining power now than you did six months ago,” according to Greg McBride, CFA, chief financial analyst for Bankrate. The time to buy depends on people\\'s individual situations, said Marc Geredes, COO of Sundae, an online real estate marketplace. “People need a place to live and it is very competitive to rent right now, as rental prices have been going up. Over the long term, residential real estate has always been a good long term investment,” he added. Experts say even though interest rates are high, at some point they are expected to go lower and homeowners may be able to refinance if they have enough equity in their homes. “According to the experts we consult with, we think prices are going to go back to pre-pandemic 2020 levels on a national level. It will vary city to city, metro to metro,” said Geredes. Much will depend on supply though, especially in the single family home sector which has seen more of a shortage than multi-family. “Until we have a lot more supply hitting these markets, I don\\'t think we\\'re gonna see a drastic decline in home prices,” Michael Gifford, the CEO the Splitero, told Yahoo Finance. Many home owners are locked in to ultra low rates after refinancing or buying during the pandemic. “That\\'s what we are seeing with a lot of the homeowners that we help. They have a three or three and a half percent mortgage,” said Gifford. “Right now, if you\\'re going to sell, there\\'s few things to buy on the market. Rents are still very expensive.

Amazon and Microsoft Corp. were neck-and-neck in the race to breach the unwelcome milestone, with the Windows software maker close behind after having lost $889 billion from a November 2021 peak. While technology and growth stocks have been punished throughout the year, fears of a recession have further dampened sentiment in the sector. The top five US technology companies by revenue have seen nearly $4 trillion in market value evaporate this year. The world’s largest online retailer has spent this year adjusting to a sharp slowdown in e-commerce growth as shoppers resumed pre-pandemic habits. Its shares have fallen almost 50% amid slowing sales, soaring costs and a jump in interest rates. Since the start of the year, co-founder Jeff Bezos has seen his fortune dwindle by about $83 billion to $109 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Last month, Amazon projected the slowest revenue growth for a holiday quarter in the company’s history as shoppers reduce their spending in the face of economic uncertainty. That sent its market value below $1 trillion for the first time since the pandemic-fueled rally in tech stocks more than two years ago. --With assistance from Divya Balji, Tom Contiliano and Jack Witzig.

Read this and more market news on the go with Yahoo Finance App. What’s hot? Anything but stocks for much of 2022. Many online savings accounts are paying north of 2.50%. A 6-month Treasury bond is yielding 4.62% on Treasury Direct. I-Bonds, the viral bond whose rate is pegged to inflation, is currently paying 6.89%. All this might be making a difference as the market digests interest rate moves amid the Fed\\'s ongoing fight against inflation. In a note on Tuesday, Bank of America’s Equity and Quant Strategy team said that clients unloaded a net $6 billion in U.S. equities, selling for the second straight week in the biggest outflows since April ‘21 — and across 11 sectors no less, the first time in five years that’s happened. And with a lot in the air and midterm election results to remove uncertainty — which is bullish, as Sam Ro wrote yesterday — a lot of indicators are leaving tea leaves for analysts to examine. One stands out from our friends at DataTrek: The two-year U.S. treasury is yielding 0.33 percentage points more than the five-year, “an unusually large difference,” DataTrek’s Nicholas Colas wrote. This is rare and has happened only a few times in recent decades: 1989, 2000, and 2006. It’s happening now and Colas says that it means that the market is saying the “Fed is going to start reducing rates in the next 1-2 years” or that there are structural inflation problems. In any case, Colas’s takeaway is that \"this is the most bullish indicator we’ve come across in weeks, even if its history says it is not especially good at calling stock market bottoms.” This is why everyone is going to be glued to the screens as the CPI report crosses Thursday, giving us the latest look at whether the Fed',\n","  \"Stocks rallied Tuesday as investors awaited the outcome of the midterm elections in the U.S. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) inched higher by 0.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) ticked higher by 335 points, or roughly 1%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) edged higher by 0.5% after wavering during afternoon trading. It was the third-straight day of gains for the major indexes ahead of another week of potential market-moving events: corporate earnings, midterm elections, and inflation data. Investors are focused on Tuesday’s midterm elections that will determine control of the House and Senate for the remainder of President Joe Biden’s first term. Historically, Wall Street has preferred a split Congress or White House, with political gridlock that could impede major policy changes, an outcome that investors see as favorable for equities. According to JPMorgan’s latest client survey, 39% of respondents were split on whether the U.S. midterm elections will be a positive catalyst for risk markets or non-event, while 21% expected negative implications. Regardless of the winner, some strategists argue that midterm outcomes have a “modest” influence in financial markets. “The overall near-term implications of the 2022 U.S. Midterm Elections are quite modest for FX markets,” Meera Chandan, FX strategist at JPMorgan, wrote in a note to clients. “Markets should thus continue taking guidance more from the Fed’s monetary policy decisions than from any new large fiscal packages. One wildcard worth flagging is the risk of renewed uncertainty around the debt ceiling.” Another closely watched item this week will be the Thursday release of October inflation data. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect headline CPI at an annual rate of 7.9%, down from 8.2% the month before. Even if the report shows prices starting to moderate, core CPI is far above the Fed’s comfort zone. “The problem is going to be that in month over month terms, I think we're still going to see a fairly strong core CPI,” Franklin Templeton Fixed Income CIO Sonal Desai told Yahoo Finance Live on Monday. “And I don't think that a combination like that, together with the relatively strong jobs numbers we got\",\n","  'Bring on Nov. 9. With the midterm elections underway today, investors are eyeing if Republicans could win back control of government and more effectively stop any and all legislation that could rattle markets. \"Gridlock, you\\'ve seen, has been pretty good for the markets,\" Maslansky and Partners president Lee Carter on Yahoo Finance Live. \"I think people are predicting that at least that\\'s the direction we\\'re going to go. And when we\\'ve talked to Republicans who are running, ... what we\\'re going to do from between now and 2024 is just stop Biden\\'s agenda.\" Recently, stocks are trading as if the Republicans — usually seen as pro business and markets —will make substantial progress. The S&P 500 has climbed nearly 5% in the past month despite a flurry of downbeat earnings reports from the likes of Amazon, Meta and many others. Investors may be right to be on the bullish side of the ledger. The S&P 500 has historically outperformed the market in the 12-month period after a midterm election, with an average return of 16.3% per data from US Bank. This is especially the case for the one and three month periods following the midterm elections, as the below graphic shows. Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

Fourth quarter earnings estimates for the S&P 500 have tanked 4.9% since Sept. 30, according to new research from Credit Suisse strategist Jonathan Golub. The downward revisions have been most acute in the tech space as the sector deals with slowing growth, which has led to large layoff announcements recently from the likes of Meta and Salesforce. \"In our view the path of inflation, interest rates, monetary policy, the economy, and earnings will continue to exert the greatest influence on markets over the next year,\" Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner in a note to clients warned. That assessment echoes what Sofi\\'s Liz Young told Yahoo Finance Live this week: \"Until we see consecutive months of inflation coming down in a meaningful way, I expect them to continue hiking and continue tightening,\" Young said. \"I think that they are quite comfortable with tightening maybe a bit too far, and then trying to sort of ask for forgiveness from markets later with the tools that they have to stimulate.\" She later added: \"I think the piece of it that hasn’t quite been priced in entirely is that earnings contraction.\" The saving grace here for investors: Earnings are still expected to grow in the fourth quarter, with Golub\\'s research presenting a path for S&P 500 earnings to rise 2.3% overall from a year ago. However, the overall picture isn\\'t pretty — especially when energy is taken out of the equation. Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

Meta said Wednesday it will slash 13% of its workforce, more than 11,000 employees, as it looks to redirect resources to Mark Zuckerberg\\'s metaverse project and appease angry shareholders. \"I want to take accountability for these decisions and for how we got here,\" Zuckerberg said in a message to employees. \"I know this is tough for everyone, and I’m especially sorry to those impacted. I view layoffs as a last resort, so we decided to rein in other sources of cost before letting teammates go. Overall, this will add up to a meaningful cultural shift in how we operate.\" Meta stock popped on hopes of a profit reacceleration in 2023, paring back the year-to-date decline to 69%. The stock was the top trending ticker on the Yahoo Finance platform until the early afternoon on Wednesday. Jefferies\\' Thill thinks Meta\\'s new cost cuts will support a higher stock price. \"Given Meta\\'s typical pattern of growing expenses below the low-end of guidance, we would not be surprised to see additional EPS upside ahead,\" Thill said. \"We expect the expense rationalization should support Meta stock trading at just 13x FY23 EPS (vs. 11x trough). Our $155 PT implies 18x our raised \\'23 EPS.\" The analyst maintained a Buy rating on Meta stock with a $155 price target, which assumes a 52% upside from current levels.

Non-farm payrolls rose by an impressive 261,000. That didn’t strike me as a recessionary print. Then an economist sitting next to me says he sees a recession in 2023 and a 2% rise in the unemployment rate. \"We have a recession call for next year,\" Deutsche Bank Securities Chief US Economist Matthew Luzzetti said. \"For a while, we\\'ve had that call. We expect it to happen around the middle of next year. We have the unemployment rate rising to 5.5% by the end of next year.\" Conflicting economic signals, no doubt about it. But conflicting signals are being seen across the economy, notably as it pertains to U.S. consumers pre-holiday and consumer-centric stocks. Under Armour’s third quarter sucked last week, and so did the company’s forward guidance. And yet the stock was embraced by the market. Crocs had a solid quarter, but inventory ballooned. Red flag, says my former analyst self. The Street welcomed the quarter anyway. Etsy had a squishy quarter, and the market took it in stride. Same goes EBay. Then Starbucks reported an 11% same-store sales increase despite ever-inflating prices for its various coffees. Where is the recession there? \"What we focus on is really: How do we sustain that ticket?\" Starbucks CFO Rachel Ruggeri told me and Yahoo Finance\\'s Brooke DiPalma in an interview. \"Because it isn\\'t just pricing, it\\'s actually volume as well, we\\'ve seen our customers purchase more... so we\\'re seeing increased volume.\" And Mastercard’s CEO Michel Miebach tells me there is nothing in his business that suggests recession is imminent. \"Currently, based on the data that we have, there is',\n","  'Don\\'t expect a big move in the markets following the much-awaited conclusion of the midterm elections, Wall Street pros contend. \"We actually think politics is going to have a somewhat minimal impact on the markets,\" Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management, said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above). Wells Fargo strategist Chris Harvey echoed Roland\\'s sentiments in a recent note to clients: \"Post-election, we would expect a small lift in the equity market over the next month (+1%) – assuming the CPI print on Thursday is not \\'hot,\\'\" Harvey wrote. \"Defensive sector outperformance (i.e., Utilities, Staples, Health Care) is expected to last assuming we see an Election Day \\'red wave.\\'\" Overall, investors don\\'t appear to share Wall Street\\'s muted optimism — at least not yet.
